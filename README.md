# TDT-frontend-test

## Overview
Welcome to The Design Trip front-end developer test. This assignment is designed to assess your proficiency in creating responsive web pages. The evaluation will focus on 
- Layout Implementation
- Responsive Design
- Semantic HTML
- Code Organization and Separation of Concerns
- SVG Techniques
- Scroll-Based Animation Handling

## Assignment Details

### Design Files

## Instructions
1. Layout Implementation 
   - Replicate the layout based on the provided designs.
   - Ensure the design is fully responsive.
2. Scroll-driven animation
   - Implement the section animations (reference in the figma file, PROTOTYPE section) using any library/technology of your choice (**only for desktops**, handle in mobile gracefully). **NOTE** - the animations are supposed to be scroll based, they are triggered on click in prototype due to figma limitations. 
   - Implement button hover effects, provided in the figma file as a component (only icon button hover animation is required). 
3. Special requirements
   - **SVG Masks or Clip-Paths:** Demonstrate understanding of SVGs by creating the curved borders for the cards using these techniques or any other appropriate methods. Avoid using plain images for this purpose

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following key factors:

1. Layout Understanding:

   - Accurate replication of the provided design.
   - Proper alignment and spacing of elements.

2. Responsive Designs:

    - The web page should be fully responsive.
    - Proper use of CSS (or CSS-in-JS) to handle different screen sizes.

3. Semantic Code:

    - Use of semantic HTML5 elements.
    - Accessibility considerations.

4. Separation of Concerns:

    - Clear separation of logic, presentation, and styles.
    - Component-based architecture. (if applicable)

5. SVG Masks and Clip-Paths:

    - Use of SVGs to create curved borders for the cards.
    - We might ask for your explanation of the approach used for this task.

6. Scroll-Based Animation:

    - Smooth and performant animations.
    - Handling of edge cases and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Submission Instructions
1. Create a new branch for your work
2. Implement the solution
3. Push changes to your branch
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Write documentation explaining your approach, any challenges you faced, and how you solved them.
